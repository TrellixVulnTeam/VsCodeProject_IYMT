# 非官方翻

我的 TensorFlow 社区翻了些文档。因社区翻是尽力而， 所以无法保它是最准的，并且反映了最新的
[官方英文文档](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=en)。如果有改此翻的建， 提交 pull request 到
[tensorflow/docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) GitHub 。要志愿地撰写或者核文，加入
[docs-zh-cn@tensorflow.org Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/docs-zh-cn)。

# Community translations

Our TensorFlow community has translated these documents. Because community
translations are *best-effort*, there is no guarantee that this is an accurate
and up-to-date reflection of the
[official English documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=en). 
If you have suggestions to improve this translation, please send a pull request 
to the [tensorflow/docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) GitHub repository. 
To volunteer to write or review community translations, contact the
[docs@tensorflow.org list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/docs).

Note: Please focus translation efforts on
[TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org) in the
[site/en/](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/site/en/)
directory. TF 1.x community docs will no longer be updated as we prepare for the
2.0 release. See
[the announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/docs/vO0gQnEXcSM/YK_ybv7tBQAJ).

# Simplified Chinese translation guide

Some technical words in English do not have a natural translation. Do *not*
translate the following words:

*   (mini-) batch
*   estimator
